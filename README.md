# Jamnesia - Poker Hand Management System

A web application to record poker hands using PokerKit, save them in PHH (Poker Hand History) format, and replay them with an interactive visual interface. Built with Flask + HTMX for a lightweight, modern web experience.

## ðŸŽ¬ Hand Replay Demo

Experience poker hands step-by-step with:
- **Visual poker table** with players positioned around the table
- **Interactive controls** (play, pause, step forward/back, speed control)
- **Real-time state tracking** (pot sizes, stack changes, board progression)
- **Action descriptions** for each move
- **Responsive design** that works on desktop and mobile

Try it: Create a sample hand and click the "ðŸŽ¬ Replay" button!

## Usage

### Input a Poker Hand

1. Navigate to "Input Hand" from the main page
2. Configure game settings (small blind, big blind)
3. Add players with their names, stacks, and hole cards
4. Set board cards (flop, turn, river) if applicable
5. Add actions in sequence (fold, check, call, bet, raise) with pot size and remaining stack after each action
6. Click "Save Hand" to generate PHH and store in database

### View Saved Hands

- The main page displays all saved hands
- Click "Details" to view complete hand information
- Click "ðŸŽ¬ Replay" to experience the hand step-by-step
- PHH format is generated automatically and displayed

### Hand Replay Experience

- **Interactive Controls**: Play, pause, step forward/backward, jump to first/last
- **Visual Table**: See players positioned around an elliptical poker table
- **Realistic Cards**: Playing cards with proper suit symbols (â™¥â™¦â™£â™ ) and red/black colors
- **Dealer Button**: 3D-styled button markers that correctly handle heads-up and multi-player games
- **Real-time Updates**: Watch pot sizes, stack changes, and board card progression through all streets
- **Action Descriptions**: Clear, accurate action labels (Call, Bet, Raise, Check, Fold, Blinds)
- **Street Transitions**: Smooth transitions between preflop, flop, turn, and river with intermediate steps
- **Speed Control**: Adjust replay speed from slow (2s) to fast (0.5s)
- **State Tracking**: Accurate tracking of player stacks, bets, and pot throughout the hand

### Sample Hand Patterns

Choose from multiple pre-configured scenarios:

- **Standard**: 3-way hand with preflop raise and flop action
- **Heads-up Battle**: Aggressive 2-player action across multiple streets with all-in finish
- **All-in Showdown**: Short stack goes all-in preflop, others call and check down
- **Bluff and Fold**: Failed bluff attempt with river action and fold to raise
- **Multi-street Action**: 4-player hand with action on all streets and turn all-in

Each pattern demonstrates different poker concepts and provides comprehensive testing of the replay system.
